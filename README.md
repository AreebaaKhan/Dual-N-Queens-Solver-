# Dual-N-Queens-Solver-
Interactive N-Queens solver using A* search and CSP backtracking with board visualization, performance metrics, and CSV export in Python/Jupyter.​

Open notebook:

Nqueen.ipynb
Run all cells (Cell → Run All)

🎮 How to Use
1. Select N (4, 6, 8, 10, 12)  ← Board size
2. [Generate]                  ← Random starting board
3. [Run A*]                    ← A* search from random state
4. [Run CSP]                   ← CSP builds solution column-by-column
5. [Compare]                   ← Side-by-side results + graphs
6. [Save CSV]                  ← Export metrics
7. [Reset]                     ← New experiment
